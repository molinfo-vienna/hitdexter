Feature: Valid predictions

  Scenario Outline: Predictions are valid
    Given a random seed set to <seed>
    And a list of <num_molecules> random molecules, where <num_none> entries are None
    And the representations of the molecules in <input_type> format

    When the HitDexter 3 model generates predictions for the molecule representations
    And the subset of the result where the input was not None is considered

    Then the result should contain the columns:
            assessment
            mol_weight
            mol_clogp
            prediction_1
            distance_to_neighbor_1
            prediction_2
            distance_to_neighbor_2
            prediction_3
            distance_to_neighbor_3
            prediction_4
            distance_to_neighbor_4
            prediction_5
            distance_to_neighbor_5
            prediction_6
            distance_to_neighbor_6
            patterns_1
            patterns_2
            patterns_3
            patterns_4
            patterns_5
            patterns_6
            patterns_7
            patterns_8
    And the value in column 'assessment' should have type 'str'
    And the value in column 'assessment' should have length greater than 0
    And the value in column 'mol_weight' should have type 'float'
    And the value in column 'mol_weight' should be between 0 and infinity
    And the value in column 'mol_clogp' should have type 'float'
    And the value in column 'prediction_1' should be between 0 and 1
    And the value in column 'distance_to_neighbor_1' should be between 0 and 1
    And the value in column 'prediction_2' should be between 0 and 1
    And the value in column 'distance_to_neighbor_2' should be between 0 and 1
    And the value in column 'prediction_3' should be between 0 and 1
    And the value in column 'distance_to_neighbor_3' should be between 0 and 1
    And the value in column 'prediction_4' should be between 0 and 1
    And the value in column 'distance_to_neighbor_4' should be between 0 and 1
    And the value in column 'prediction_5' should be between 0 and 1
    And the value in column 'distance_to_neighbor_5' should be between 0 and 1
    And the value in column 'prediction_6' should be between 0 and 1
    And the value in column 'distance_to_neighbor_6' should be between 0 and 1
    And the value in column 'patterns_1' should have type 'list'
    And the value in column 'patterns_2' should have type 'list'
    And the value in column 'patterns_3' should have type 'list'
    And the value in column 'patterns_4' should have type 'list'
    And the value in column 'patterns_5' should have type 'list'
    And the value in column 'patterns_6' should have type 'list'
    And the value in column 'patterns_7' should have type 'list'
    And the value in column 'patterns_8' should have type 'list'


  Examples:
  | seed | num_molecules | num_none | input_type |
  | 1    | 10            | 0        | smiles     |
  | 2    | 10            | 1        | smiles     |
  | 3    | 10            | 2        | smiles     |
  | 4    | 10            | 10       | smiles     |
