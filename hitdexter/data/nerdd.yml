  title: How Likely is my Compound a Frequent Hitter?
  description: |
    Hit Dexter is a machine learning approach to estimate how likely a small molecule is
    to trigger a positive response in biochemical and biological assays. The models were
    derived from a dataset of 250,000 compounds with experimentally determined activity
    for at least 100 different protein groups.

    ## Documentation of Hit Dexter 3 (coming soon)

    ## Hit Dexter and Hit Dexter 2.0 versions

    As the workflow for data preparation was updated and improved during Hit Dexter 2.0,
    only these data sets are used. This means Hit Dexter as it was in the very beginning
    does not exist anymore.

    Further the models that are accessible via the web server are not the models that
    were published in the Hit Dexter 2.0 paper, but were built with the same procedure
    described in the paper but with updated versions of
    scikit-learn[\[1\]](#Reference) (now: 0.20.1; old: 0.19.1), imbalance
    learn[\[2\]](#Reference) (now: 0.4.3; old: 0.3.1) and RDKit[\[3\]](#Reference) (now:
    2018.09.1; old: 2017.09.3).

    ### Introduction

    Hit Dexter 2.0 is a freely available web service for assessing the risk of small
    molecules to cause false-positive readouts in biochemical assays. Predictions
    obtained with Hit Dexter 2.0 may serve as a valuable tool for decision support and
    compound deprioritization but is not intended for use as a hard filter for
    discarding compounds. For a detailed discussion of the scope and limitations of Hit
    Dexter 2.0, see our recent publication.[\[4\]](#Reference)

    Hit Dexter 2.0 features a number of different models and approaches for compound
    vetting:

    * Four machine learning models (classifiers) to identify
      * compounds which are likely to show moderate or high hit rates in primary screening assays (PSA) and are hence regarded as potentially promiscuous compounds
      * compounds which are likely to show high hit rates in primary screening assays (PSA) and are hence regarded as potentially highly promiscuous compounds
      * compounds which are likely to show moderate or high hit rates in confirmatory dose-response assays (CDRA) and are hence regarded as potentially promiscuous compounds
      * compounds which are likely to show high hit rates in confirmatory dose-response assays (CDRA) and are hence regarded as potentially highly promiscuous compounds
    * Similarity-based approaches to measure the distance to the
      * closest known aggregate-forming compound
      * closest known dark chemical matter compound (definitions provided below)
    * Rule-based approaches to flag
      * compounds based on scaffolds which have been linked to pan-assay interference (PAINS)
      * undesirable molecules, identified based on substructures

    The definitions of the individual promiscuity classes are summarized in Table 1. For
    example, compounds are classified as “highly promiscuous” if their active-to-tested
    ratio (ATR) is greater than 5.4% for PSAs and greater than 10% for CDRAs.

    The ATR defines the ratio between the number of protein clusters for which a
    compound was measured as active on at least one protein of that cluster vs. the
    total number of protein clusters a compound was measured on.

    Each of the classifiers was trained on approximately 250k compounds (Table 1) which
    have been measured for activity on at least 50 distinct proteins (i.e. proteins with
    distinct sequence identity as determined by a protein sequence clustering approach).
    Morgan2 fingerprints served as descriptors.

    Table 1. Composition of the Data Sets and Definition of Thresholds for Class Labeling.

    | Assigned promiscuity class                               | # unique compounds in data set | # unique compounds in PSA50 | # unique compounds in CDRA50 | Threshold definitiona       | Threshold PSA50b | Threshold CDRA50b |
    |----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
    | Non-promiscuous (NP)                                     | Training set:                  | 222 272                     | 211 264                      | ATR &lt; ATRmean            | 0.008            | 0.015             |

    ### Similarity-based approaches to measure the distance to known aggregators and dark chemical matter

    Hit Dexter 2.0 reports the distance to the closest known aggregate-forming compound
    (aggregator) collected in a large data set that was published in
    2015.[\[6\]](#Reference) Hit Dexter 2.0 retrieves similarity values directly from
    the Aggregator Advisor web service.[\[7\]](#Reference) The reported similarity is a
    Tanimoto coefficient based on the standard axonpath fingerprint in JChemBase
    (ChemAxon, Chemaxon.com). If the Aggregator Advisor web service cannot be reached at
    this time, Hit Dexter 2.0 will not report predictions for this calculation (the
    value reported will be “-1”or “null”).

    Hit Dexter 2.0 also reports the distance of the compound(s) of interest to the
    closest of 140k compounds known as dark chemical matter.[\[8\]](#Reference) Dark
    chemical matter describes compounds which have been tested in at least one hundred
    different biochemical assays and have never shown activity.

    ### Rule-based approaches to flag undesirable molecules

    As additional information the following rule sets are provided:

    *   The “hard filters” rule set developed at Glaxo Wellcome,[\[9\]](#Reference) consisting of 55 patterns of undesired functional groups.
    *   A rule set developed at the University of Dundee,[\[10\]](#Reference) consisting of 105 patterns of unwanted functional groups and substructures that likely cause interference with HTS assays.
    *   The “HTS deck filters” rule set developed at Bristol-Meyers Squibb,[\[11\]](#Reference) consisting of 180 patterns of unwanted functional groups derived from intuition and experience.
    *   The SureChEMBL rule set of ToxAlert,[\[12\]](#Reference) consisting of 166 patterns of toxicophores.
    *   The “excluded functionality filters” rule set of the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository,[\[13\]](#Reference) consisting of 116 patterns for removing unwanted functional groups.
    *   The “Lint” rule set developed at Pfizer,[\[14\]](#Reference) consisting 57 patterns of problematic functional groups during drug optimization.
    *   The PAINS set of substructures linked to assay interference,[\[15\]](#Reference) consisting of 480 patterns. Note that the original PAINS patterns were encoded by Sybyl line notation[\[15\]](#Reference) whereas the Hit Dexter 2.0 web service utilizes SMARTS patterns in combination with the substructure search implemented in RDKit.[\[3\]](#Reference) This may lead to differing results in some cases.
    *   A set of 28 substructures derived from undesirable compounds. This is a subset of rules recently introduced by investigators from GlaxoSmithKline. The 28 substructures are listed in Table S2 of ref [\[16\]](#Reference) (value “remove” in column “GSK Recommendation”).

    Patterns that cannot be parsed by RDKit were corrected according to Table 2.

    ### Usage

    #### Data preparation and upload

    Molecular structures are loaded onto the Hit Dexter 2.0 web service either by directly drawing a molecule with the JSME editor,[\[17\]](#Reference) by pasting a SMILES into the field “Enter SMILES”, or by uploading a text file containing a list of SMILES. Hit Dexter 2.0 runs a thorough data preparation protocol to standardize the structural input. Therefore, chemical structures do not need to be preprocessed by the user with respect to hydrogen annotation, aromatization, protonation, tautomerism and stereochemistry. Salts are also recognized, and the minor components removed prior to calculations. For further information, see the original publication of Hit Dexter 2.0 ([www.dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00677](http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00677)).

    Lists of SMILES should be formatted as shown in the following examples:

    Example 1: One SMILES per row with no additional data

    CCOC(=O)N1CCN(CC1)C2=C(C(=O)C2=O)N3CCN(CC3)C4=CC=C(C=C4)OC

    C1=CC(=C(C=C1C2=C(C(=O)C3=C(C=C(C=C3O2)O)O)O)O)O

    C1=CC(=C(C=C1O)O)C(=O)C=CC2=CC(=C(C(=C2)O)O)O

    Example 2: One SMILES per row with additional data (only space is allowed at the moment)

    #### Running the calculations

    Calculations are started by clicking the “Submit” button. A new web page will load
    which reports on the progress of calculations and displays a web link that allows
    users to return and inspect the results ones all calculations have been completed.

    #### Analyzing the results

    The results page mainly consists of a table (heat map) which presents the
    predictions for the query molecules and models.

    Users not familiar with the methods and rule-sets employed by Hit Dexter are advised
    to closely observe the assessment provided in the “Comments” field. “Comments”
    summarizes the outcomes of all individual models of Hit Dexter 2.0 and also gives
    indications of the confidence of individual predictions (based on the similarity of
    the query compound(s) to the nearest neighbors in the training sets).

    The following color gradients are used in the table:

    *   Molecular weight: < 200 Da red; 400 Da green; > 600 Da red
    *   logP: <1 red; 2 green; >3 red
    *   Probability reported by the individual classifiers: 0.00 green; 1.00 red
    *   Distance (Tanimoto similarity of Morgan2 fingerprints) to the most similar molecule present in the training data: 0.00 green; 1.00 red
    *   Number of patterns matched for the individual rule sets: 0 green; >3 red

    The table rows can be sorted by clicking on the sorter symbols located within the
    header cells of the respective columns.

    Providing exactly the same SMILES more than once results in deletion of the
    duplicates. If names are provided only the name of the last entry (with respect to
    the input file) is kept.

    ### Exporting results

    All results can be downloaded as a CSV file by clicking the “Download (.csv)” button
    on the results page.

    ### Analyzing error messages and warnings

    For any structural input that cannot be successfully processed and standardized by
    Hit Dexter 2.0, an error code is reported. A description of the individual error
    codes is provided in Table 3. In case of questions, use the feedback and support
    page of our web service to get in touch with us
    ([https://nerdd.univie.ac.at/feedback\_support/](https://nerdd.univie.ac.at/feedback_support/)).

    If the Aggregator Advisor web service cannot be reached at this time, Hit Dexter 2.0
    will not report predictions for this calculation (the value reported will be “-1”or
    “null”).
